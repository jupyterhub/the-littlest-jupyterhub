# When tljh.installer runs, the hub' environment as typically found in
# /opt/tljh/hub, is upgraded to use these packages.
#
# When a new release is made, the lower bounds should be incremented to the
# latest release to help us narrow the versions based on knowing what tljh
# version is installed from inspecting this file.
#
# If a dependency is bumped to a new major version, we should make a major
# version release of tljh.

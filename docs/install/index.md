# Installing

The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH) can run on any server that is running **Debian 11** or **Ubuntu 20.04** or **22.04** on a amd64 or arm64 CPU architecture.
Earlier versions of Ubuntu and Debian are not supported, nor are other Linux distributions.
We have a bunch of tutorials to get you started.

Tutorials to create a new server from scratch on a cloud provider & run TLJH
on it. These are **recommended** if you do not have much experience setting up
servers.
